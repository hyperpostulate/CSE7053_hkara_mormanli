# CSE7053_hkara_mormanli
CSE7053 Social Network Analysis Course Term Project

In this work, we will be used two relations ['TAKDIR' and 'DOGUMGUNU'] and one node property [isManager] to perform a qualitative analysis.

We regard 'TAKDIR' as a professional endorsement, 'DOGUMGUNU' as an indicator for a personal friendship.

The goal is discriminate 'pure' professional endorsements from so-called 'professional endorsements' based on personal friendship,
and to reveal 'true' significance of a employee.

To calculate centrality metrics, we used 'Neo4j Graph Algorithms Release 3.3.0.0' https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-graph-algorithms/releases.
