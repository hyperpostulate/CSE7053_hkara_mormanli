# CSE7053_hkara_mormanli
CSE7053 Social Network Analysis Course Term Project

In this project, we used a Neo4J database (provided by professor) and SQLite to generate a report for a fictional Human Resources department, could be used for
enhancing performance evaluation processes' efficiency.

The goal is discriminate 'pure' professional endorsements from so-called 'professional endorsements' based on personal friendship or possible factionalism
and observe these misleading effects quantitatively, to reveal 'true' significance of a employee.

To calculate centrality metrics, we used 'Neo4j Graph Algorithms Release 3.3.0.0' https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-graph-algorithms/releases.
